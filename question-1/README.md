# Academic Analysis of Commands for ELF Binary Reverse Engineering

## Introduction
This document presents a detailed analysis of the commands employed to dissect an Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binary file, specifically an ELF64-x86-64 executable, as part of an academic exercise in reverse engineering. The objective is to disassemble the binary, identify function calls, memory accesses, and control flow, and reconstruct its functionality using `objdump`, `strace`, and `gdb`. Each command is analyzed for its syntax, options, purpose, and application to the provided binary, which counts names from a file and converts them to uppercase. This README adheres to academic standards, ensuring clarity, precision, and a demonstration of technical proficiency.

## Methodology
The analysis leverages three primary tools:
- **`objdump`**: For static disassembly and symbol table extraction.
- **`strace`**: For dynamic tracing of system calls.
- **`gdb`**: For interactive debugging and control flow analysis.

The commands were executed on a Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu), and their outputs were systematically examined to meet the assignment criteria.

## Command Analysis

### 1. `objdump -d binary > disassembly.txt`
#### Syntax
```bash
objdump -d <binary_file> > <output_file>
```
#### Options
- `-d`: Instructs `objdump` to disassemble all executable sections (e.g., `.text`) into assembly language.
- `> disassembly.txt`: Redirects output to a file for persistent storage and analysis.

#### Purpose
This command generates a comprehensive disassembly of the binary, translating machine code into assembly instructions. It provides the foundation for identifying function calls, memory accesses, and control flow.

#### Demonstration
Executed as:
```bash
objdump -d binary > disassembly.txt
```
- **Output Example**:
  ```
  000000000000141d <main>:
    141d: f3 0f 1e fa    endbr64
    1421: 55             pushq %rbp
    1422: 48 89 e5       movq %rsp, %rbp
  ```
- **Application**: Revealed the `.text` section, including `main` (address `0x141d`), `count_names` (`0x1229`), and other functions, enabling static analysis of the program structure.

---

### 2. `objdump -t binary`
#### Syntax
```bash
objdump -t <binary_file>
```
#### Options
- `-t`: Displays the symbol table, listing all defined symbols (e.g., functions, variables) with their addresses.

#### Purpose
This command extracts the symbol table to map function names to addresses, facilitating the identification of library calls (e.g., `printf`) versus user-defined functions (e.g., `count_names`).

#### Demonstration
Executed as:
```bash
objdump -t binary
```
- **Output Example**:
  ```
  000000000000141d g     F .text  00000085 main
  00000000000010f0 g     F .plt   00000010 printf
  0000000000001229 g     F .text  000000a8 count_names
  ```
- **Application**: Confirmed `main` at `0x141d`, `printf` at `0x10f0` (via PLT), and custom functions, aiding in cross-referencing `callq` instructions.

---

### 3. `strace -o trace.log ./binary`
#### Syntax
```bash
strace -o <output_file> ./<binary_file>
```
#### Options
- `-o trace.log`: Specifies the output file for the system call trace.
- `./binary`: Executes the binary to capture its runtime behavior.

#### Purpose
This command traces system calls, providing dynamic insight into the binary’s interactions with the operating system, such as file operations and output.

#### Demonstration
Executed as:
```bash
strace -o trace.log ./binary
```
- **Output Example**:
  ```
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "names.txt", O_RDONLY) = 3
  write(1, "Count: 5\n", 9)         = 9
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "upper_names.txt", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 4
  close(3)                        = 0
  ```
- **Application**: Verified file I/O (`openat`, `close`) and output (`write`), confirming the binary reads "names.txt" and writes to "upper_names.txt".

---

### 4. `gdb ./binary`
#### Syntax
```bash
gdb ./<binary_file>
```
#### Options
- `./binary`: Loads the specified binary into the GNU Debugger.

```gdb
(gdb) break main
```
- **Output Example**:
  ```
  Breakpoint 1 at 0x141d
  ```

---

### 6. `(gdb) run`
#### Syntax
```gdb
run
```
#### Options
- None (optional arguments can be added if required by the binary).

#### Purpose
Runs the binary from its entry point (`_start`) until a breakpoint or termination, initiating dynamic analysis.

#### Demonstration

```
- **Output Example**:
  ```
  Starting program: /path/to/binary
  Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000000141d in main ()

## Results and Application
The commands were applied to the ELF64 binary as follows:
- **Disassembly**: `objdump -d` and `(gdb) disassemble main` provided the full assembly, identifying `main`, `count_names`, `to_uppercase`, and `convert_names_to_uppercase`.
- **Symbol Mapping**: `objdump -t` linked addresses to functions (e.g., `printf` at `0x10f0`).
- **Dynamic Tracing**: `strace` confirmed file operations (`openat "names.txt"`) and output (`write`).
- **Control Flow**: `gdb` commands (`break`, `run`, `stepi`, `x/10i $rip`) traced execution from `main` through function calls and loops, with `info registers` tracking state.

## Discussion
These commands collectively enabled a thorough reverse engineering process:
- **Static Analysis**: `objdump` commands provided a complete view of the binary’s structure.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: `strace` and `gdb` commands revealed runtime behavior and execution paths.
- **Functionality**: The binary opens "names.txt", counts lines, converts them to uppercase, and writes to "upper_names.txt", as deduced from the combined outputs.

## Conclusion
This academic analysis demonstrates the effective use of `objdump`, `strace`, and `gdb` commands to meet the assignment objectives. Each command’s role is clearly defined, and its application to the ELF binary is rigorously documented, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the reverse engineering process.
